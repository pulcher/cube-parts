# cube-parts

This the repository for all of the parts for the multiboard that are on some of the cubes.

If you don't have one on your chosen cube and want some, talk to send some email to me.

The file [cube-part-plates.3mg](https://github.com/pulcher/cube-parts/blob/main/cube-part-plates.3mf) contains all the plates that have been used in the cubes.

If you would like to have something that is not on the current plates, I would suggest the links below for some ideas:
